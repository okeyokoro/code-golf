the game of pig

- 2 players (but you could have more)
- players take turns
- at each turn the player makes choices:
  -  hold / stop rolling
  -  roll a 6 sided die (a player can roll multiple times in a given turn)
     -  rolling a 1 causes you to only score a 1 (destorying a compounded score), then yield your turn
     -  rolling any other thing allows you to increase your pending score
  
- the goal of the game is to score 50pts

making it for 2 players is easy...
so, obviously, Norvig wants us to program an AI for the game
