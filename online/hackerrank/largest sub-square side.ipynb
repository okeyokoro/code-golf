    "A grid can be divided into `square`  subgrids that have rows and columns ≤ the number of rows and columns in the original grid. For each subgrid, all of its elements are summed to get a `total value` for the subgrid. A fellow analyst provides an integer and wants to know the maximum number of rows or columns of the square subgrids such that all of the subgrids of that size have a total value less than that integer.\n",
