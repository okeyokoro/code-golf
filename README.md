# Welcome, wary traveler...

You have now arrived at __Adventures in Competitive Programming__; a repository containing
[Daniel Okey-Okoro's](https://danielokeyokoro.com) solutions to interesting problems he
encountered as he travelled the internet in search of:

- programming competitions,
- usecases for data structures,
- algorithm applications,
- coding interview questions,
- code challenges,
- security exploits,
- CS research

...and other things of a similar nature.

## Getting Up & Running

```bash
git clone git@github.com:okeyokoro/competitive-programming-adventures.git

cd competitive-programming-adventures

pip install jupterlab
# ^ if not installed already

jupyter lab
```

## The Usual Suspects

- [EPI](books/elements-of-programming-interviews)
- [foo.bar](companies/google/foo.bar)
- [freecodecamp](online/freecodecamp/coding-interview-prep)
- [codility](online/codility)
- [leetcode](online/leetcode)
- [udacity](courses/udacity)

Please feel free to peruse this repository at your leisure, and enjoy. Daniel has taken the time to comment/document
his code with the view of not just explaining but *entertaining*. He sees this repo as more of a journal/memoir than
a collection of code samples.
